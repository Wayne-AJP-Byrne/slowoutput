# slowoutput
Slows down stdout to emulate OLD terminal output (think baudrate)
A really simple python program to output stdout 
It can take 1 parameter which is milliseconds

(NOTE: make sure you make the file executable with chmod +x slowoutput.py)
Usage example:

ls -laR | slowoutput 0.01

If no parameter is set deafult value is 0.05

(Wriiten in Python 3, and this is my test as i'm new to github)
